"DiagnosticReport","","Report
TestResultResultsLabsLaboratoryImaging ReportRadiology Report","",0,*,"","","","","onco-core-GenomicsReport","Genetic analysis summary report. The report may include one or more tests, with two distinct test types. The first type is a targeted mutation test, where a specific mutation on a specific gene is tested for. The result is either positive or negative for that mutation. The second type is a more general test for variants. This type of test returns the identity of variants found in a certain region of the genome.

The identity of non-genomic laboratory tests is typically represented by a LOINC code. However, many genetic tests and panels do not have LOINC codes, although some might have an identifier in NCBI Genetic Testing Registry (GTR), a central location for voluntary submission of genetic test information by providers. To identify the diagnostic report, the name of the report must be in the text sub-field of the code structure. If there is a coded identifier from GTR, LOINC, or other source, then it should be included into the the code sub-field of the code structure. If there is no suitable code, the code can be omitted.

Conformance note: To be conformant to US Core, the code attribute must be a LOINC code, if available. If there is no suitable code in LOINC, then a code from an alternative code system (such as GTR) can be used.

Implementation note: The performer of the test (organization or practitioner) should be included in the FHIR profile as the performer.actor.

Conformance note: The category for this profile is set to GE (Genetics), a code from http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/diagnostic-service-sections. This is contrary to the [Argonaut](http://www.fhir.org/guides/argonaut/r2/) and [US Core](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU3/index.html) specifications, which require the category 'LAB' in diagnostic reports containing laboratory results. This is assumed to be an oversight in the US Core and Argonaut specifications.","This is intended to capture a single report and is not suitable for use in displaying summary information that covers multiple reports.
