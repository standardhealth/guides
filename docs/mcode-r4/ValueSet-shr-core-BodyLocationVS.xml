<p><b>BodyLocationVS ValueSet</b></p>
<p>Codes that describe normal and pathologic anatomic systems, regions, cavities, and spaces. The code set includes codes from the SNOMED CT hierarchy descending from 123037004 'Body Structure'.

Body location is a flexible structure that allows the location to be determined by a single code, or a code plus laterality and/or orientation. The body location can also be specified in relation to one or more body landmarks. SNOMED CT is used in all cases.

* Code only: The code should include (precoordinate) laterality and/orientation to the degree necessary to completely specify the body location.
* Code plus laterality and/or orientation: The basic code augmented by codes specifying the body side and/or anatomical orientation.
* Relation to landmark: The location relative to a landmark is specified by:
- Establishing the location and type of landmark using a body site code and optional laterality/orientation, and
- Specifying the direction and distance from the landmark to the body location.

Note that BodyLocation is a data type (a reusable structure), not a stand-alone entity. The concept is similar to how a postal address can apply to a person, location, or organization. This contrasts with FHIR's stand-alone BodySite (aka BodyStructure in r4) which 'is not ... intended for describing the type of anatomical location but rather a specific body site on a specific patient' (FHIR 3.5).</p>
