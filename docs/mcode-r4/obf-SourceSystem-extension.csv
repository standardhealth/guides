This property is optional, as some systems will assume that all records that it contains originated in that system, however it is anticipated that it will become increasingly commonplace for records from multiple systems and organizations will be comingled in order to provide a complete picture of the patient's health record.","","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"Extension",0,*,"ele-1
