      <td><p>Genetic analysis summary report. The report may include one or more tests, with two distinct test types. The first type is a targeted mutation test, where a specific mutation on a specific gene is tested for. The result is either positive or negative for that mutation. The second type is a more general test for variants. This type of test returns the identity of variants found in a certain region of the genome.</p>

<p>The identity of non-genomic laboratory tests is typically represented by a LOINC code. However, many genetic tests and panels do not have LOINC codes, although some might have an identifier in NCBI Genetic Testing Registry (GTR), a central location for voluntary submission of genetic test information by providers. To identify the diagnostic report, the name of the report must be in the text sub-field of the code structure. If there is a coded identifier from GTR, LOINC, or other source, then it should be included into the the code sub-field of the code structure. If there is no suitable code, the code can be omitted.</p>

<p>Conformance note: To be conformant to US Core, the code attribute must be a LOINC code, if available. If there is no suitable code in LOINC, then a code from an alternative code system (such as GTR) can be used.</p>

<p>Implementation note: The performer of the test (organization or practitioner) should be included in the FHIR profile as the performer.actor.</p>

<p>Conformance note: The category for this profile is set to GE (Genetics), a code from http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/diagnostic-service-sections. This is contrary to the <a href="http://www.fhir.org/guides/argonaut/r2/">Argonaut</a> and <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU3/index.html">US Core</a> specifications, which require the category ‘LAB’ in diagnostic reports containing laboratory results.

It can be used to compare the effectiveness of different therapies and to help assess the prognosis of certain patients, such as those with certain cancers. The KPS score ranges from 0 to 100 in intervals of 10. Higher scores are associated with better functional status, with 100 representing no symptoms or evidence of disease, and 0 representing death.</p>

      <td><p>A record of the use of a medication (individual administration or entire course). The use may be reported by the patient or clinician and adminstration does not have to be directly observed.</p>

<p>Implementation note: Although FHIR supports the asserter (information source) and date asserted, it does not have a place for the author (who created and is responsible for the statement) and recorder (who entered the statement). Extensions are provided.</p>

<p>Conformance note: The treatment of ‘not taken’ has changed from DSTU2 and STU3 to R4. In R4, status and statusReason are used to indicate medications not taken. For upward compatibility, the ‘not taken’ attributes are profiled out.
ReasonCode is a choice of CodeableConcept or ref(Condition) in DSTU2, and limited to one reason (pick a type). In STU3 and R4, there can be multiple reason codes, and multiple reason references, simultaneously.</p>

<p>Implementation note: Preference is given to using the National Library of Medicine (NLM) RxNorm terminology for medications. RxNorm is a coding standard established by the Office of the National Coordinator (ONC). However, RxNorm is restricted to FDA-approved drugs and does not include clinical trial drugs. MedicationStatement allows for the inclusion of other coding systems like the NCI Thesaurus (NCIT) to represent clinical trial oncology drugs.</p>

<p>Conformance note: For the code attribute, to be compliant with <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU3/index.html">US Core Profiles</a>, SNOMED CT must be used unless there is no suitable code, in which case ICD-10-CM can be used.</p>

Tumor marker tests are generally used to guide cancer treatment decisions and monitor treatment, as well as to predict the chance of recovery and cancer recurrence. A tumor marker is a substance found in tissue or blood or other body fluids that may be a sign of cancer or certain benign (noncancer) conditions. Most tumor markers are made by both normal cells and cancer cells, but they are made in larger amounts by cancer cells. A tumor marker may help to diagnose cancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working or if cancer has come back. Examples of tumor markers include CA-125 (in ovarian cancer), CA 15-3 (in breast cancer), CEA (in colon cancer), and PSA (in prostate cancer). Tumor markers differ from genetic markers in that they are measured at the levels of the protein and substance post-RNA protein synthesis. (Source: Adapted from <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms">NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms</a> and <a href="https://www.cancer.net/">Cancer.net</a>)</p>

<p>Implementation note: The data value for TumorMarkerTest has cardinality is 0..1 (required if known) because when the test result is indeterminate, no quantitative data value will be reported. Instead, the reason for the null value will be reported in the DataAbsentReason field.</p>

<p>Note to FHIR implementers: Objective FHIR includes Status and Identifier fields on DomainResource because these two attributes occur in almost every FHIR resource. The most significant exception are 3 or 4 resources that use an ‘active’ flag instead of coded status value. There is no apparent pattern to this inconsistency. FHIR resources that use a coded status have active and inactive as status values. In the spirit of providing a consistent object-oriented logical model for FHIR, Objective FHIR uses status across all domain resources.</p>
