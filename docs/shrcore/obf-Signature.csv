"Signature","","","",0,*,"","","","","obf-Signature","A Signature holds an electronic representation of a signature and its supporting context in a FHIR accessible form. The signature may either be a cryptographic type (XML DigSig or a JWS), which is able to provide non-repudiation proof, or it may be a graphical image that represents a signature or a signature process.","The elements of the Signature Resource are for ease of access of these elements. For digital signatures (Xml DigSig, JWS), the non-repudiation proof comes from the Signature  validation, which includes validation of the referenced objects (e.g. Resources) (a.k.a., Content) in the XML-Signature Detached form.","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"Signature",0,*,"ele-1
