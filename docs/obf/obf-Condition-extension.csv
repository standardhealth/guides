"Extension","","","",0,*,"","","","","Condition","A condition that is or may be present in a subject. 'Condition' is interpreted broadly and could be a disorder, abnormality, problem, injury, complaint, functionality, illness, disease, ailment, sickness, affliction, upset, difficulty, disorder, symptom, worry, or trouble.
The Observation-based class, ConditionAbsent, should be used to describe conditions that are not present or negative findings.
SHR Condition uses the SHR BodyLocation structure that includes not only a code, but optional laterality, direction, clock direction, and distance. If included, the distance is measured from the location specified by the code, laterality, and direction.","","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"Extension",0,*,"ele-1
