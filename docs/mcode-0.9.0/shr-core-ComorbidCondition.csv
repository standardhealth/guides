","","The relationship between a landmark that helps determine a body location and the body location itself. The location relative to a landmark is specified by:
* Specifying the location and type of landmark using a body site code and optional laterality/orientation,
* Specifying the direction from the landmark to the body location, and
* Specifying the distance from the landmark to the body location.

The RelationToLandmark element is part of BodyLocation, a flexible structure that allows the location to be determined by a single code, or a code plus laterality and/or orientation. The body location can also be specified in relation to one or more body landmarks. SNOMED CT is used in all cases.

+ Code only: The code should include (precoordinate) laterality and/orientation to the degree necessary to completely specify the body location.
+ Code plus laterality and/or orientation: The basic code augmented by codes specifying the body side and/or anatomical orientation.
+ Relation to landmark: The location relative to a landmark is specified by:
- Establishing the location and type of landmark using a body site code and optional laterality/orientation, and
- Specifying the direction and distance from the landmark to the body location.
