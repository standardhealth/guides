"Extension","","","",0,*,"","","","","GeneStudied","A gene targeted for mutation analysis, identified in HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) notation. The required code is HGNC gene ID. Gene IDs are of the format HGNC:n, where n is a unique number. Only the number, n, should be given as the code. For example, the HGNC identifier for the EGFR gene is 3236. The display text associated with the code should be the HGNC official gene symbol. For example, the official gene symbol for epidermal growth factor receptor is EGFR.","","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"Extension",0,1,"",""
