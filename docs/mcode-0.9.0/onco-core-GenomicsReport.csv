TestResultResultsLabsLaboratory","",0,*,"","","","","onco-core-GenomicsReport","Genetic analysis summary report. The report may include one or more tests, with two distinct test types. The first type is a targeted mutation test, where a specific mutation on a specific gene is tested for. The result is either positive or negative for that mutation. The second type is a more general test for variants. This type of test returns the identity of variants found in a certain region of the genome.

The identity of laboratory tests is typically represented by a LOINC code. However, many genetic tests and panels do not have LOINC codes, although some might have an identifier in NCBI Genetic Testing Registry (GTR), a central location for voluntary submission of genetic test information by providers. To identify the diagnostic report, the name of the report must be in the text sub-field of the code structure. If there is a coded identifier from GTR, LOINC, or other source, then it should be included into the the code sub-field of the code structure. If there is no suitable code, the code can be omitted.

The performer of the test (organization or practitioner) should be included in the FHIR profile as the performer.actor.

FHIR implementation note: The category for this profile is set to GE (Genetics), a code from http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/diagnostic-service-sections. This may be contrary to the Argonaut specification, which assigns the category LAB to any diagnostic report containing a laboratory result.","This is intended to capture a single report, and is not suitable for use in displaying summary information that covers multiple reports.
