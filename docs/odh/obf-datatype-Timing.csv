"Timing","","","",0,*,"","","","","obf-datatype-Timing","A timing schedule that specifies an event that may occur multiple times.
Timing offers a choice of multiple OccurrenceTime (used is used to specify specific times), or recurrence patterns.","Describes the occurrence of an event that may occur multiple times. Timing schedules are used for specifying when events are expected or requested to occur, and may also be used to represent the summary of a past or ongoing event.  For simplicity, the definitions of Timing components are expressed as 'future' events, but such components can also be used to describe historic or ongoing events.

A Timing schedule can be a list of events and/or criteria for when the event happens, which can be expressed in a structured form and/or as a code. When both event and a repeating specification are provided, the list of events should be understood as an interpretation of the information in the repeat structure.","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"Timing",0,*,"","","N/A","n/a","QSET<TS> (GTS)"
