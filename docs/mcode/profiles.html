<p>Note to FHIR implementers: The Argonaut and US Core IGs both state that panels (related groups of observations) should be represented by the DiagnosticReport resource. mCODE deviates from this approach by using Observation for panels. This is because panels can contain other panels, but a DiagnosticReport cannot contain other DiagnosticReports. Nested panels are, in fact, quite common in LOINC (see 39135-9 Wound assessment panel for an example of a deeply nested panel). To represent nested panels, the each sub-panel <em>must be</em> an Observation. Of course, any sub-panel can also be a stand-alone panel, as well. Following the Argonaut/US Core recommended approach of using DiagnosticReport would imply that many or perhaps all panels would have to be represented twice: once as an Observation to permit the panel to be used as a sub-panel, and once as a DiagnosticReport to permit it to be used as a top-level panel. The mCODE authors believe there is little added value in representing panels as DiagnosticReports when Observation provides additional opportunity for nesting, and equivalent expressive power.</p>

(Source: <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/tumor-marker/">NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms</a>).

SHR Condition uses the SHR BodyLocation structure that includes not only a code, but optional laterality, direction, clock direction, and distance. If included, the distance is measured from the location specified by the code, laterality, and direction.</p>

Device type has extensible mappings to different value sets in Argonaut and US-Core, however both value sets have identical SNOMED content (descendants of 49062001 (Device). We adopt the US-Core value set, which is allowable because the binding is extensible.</p>

<p>Note to FHIR implementers: SHR includes Status and Identifier fields on DomainResource because these two attributes occur in almost every FHIR resource. The most significant exception are 3 or 4 resources that use an ‘active’ flag instead of coded status value. There is no apparent pattern to this inconsistency. FHIR resources that use a coded status have active and inactive as status values. In the spirit of providing a consistent object-oriented logical model for FHIR, SHR uses status across all domain resources.</p>
