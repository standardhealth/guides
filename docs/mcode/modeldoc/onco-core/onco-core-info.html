The second type is a more general test for variants. This type of test returns the identity of variants found in a certain region of the genome.</p>
<p>The identity of non-genomic laboratory tests is typically represented by a LOINC code. However, many genetic tests and panels do not have LOINC codes, although some might have an identifier in NCBI Genetic Testing Registry (GTR), a central location for voluntary submission of genetic test information by providers. To identify the diagnostic report, the name of the report must be in the text sub-field of the code structure. If there is a coded identifier from GTR, LOINC, or other source, then it should be included into the the code sub-field of the code structure. If there is no suitable code, the code can be omitted.</p>
<p>Conformance note: To be conformant to US Core, the code attribute must be a LOINC code, if available. If there is no suitable code in LOINC, then a code from an alternative code system (such as GTR) can be used.</p>
<p>Implementation note: The performer of the test (organization or practitioner) should be included in the FHIR profile as the performer.actor.</p>
<p>Conformance note: The category for this profile is set to GE (Genetics), a code from http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/diagnostic-service-sections. This is contrary to the <a href="http://www.fhir.org/guides/argonaut/r2/">Argonaut</a> and <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU3/index.html">US Core</a> specifications, which require the category 'LAB' in diagnostic reports containing laboratory results. This is assumed to be an oversight in the US Core and Argonaut specifications.</p></div>

          <div class="block"><p>The result of a tumor marker test. Tumor marker tests are generally used to guide cancer treatment decisions and monitor treatment, as well as to predict the chance of recovery and cancer recurrence. A tumor marker is a substance found in tissue or blood or other body fluids that may be a sign of cancer or certain benign (noncancer) conditions. Most tumor markers are made by both normal cells and cancer cells, but they are made in larger amounts by cancer cells. A tumor marker may help to diagnose cancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working or if cancer has come back. Examples of tumor markers include CA-125 (in ovarian cancer), CA 15-3 (in breast cancer), CEA (in colon cancer), and PSA (in prostate cancer). Tumor markers differ from genetic markers in that they are measured at the levels of the protein and substance post-RNA protein synthesis.

<p>Implementation note: The data value for TumorMarkerTest has cardinality is 0..1 (required if known) because when the test result is indeterminate, no quantitative data value will be reported. Instead, the reason for the null value will be reported in the DataAbsentReason field.</p></div>
